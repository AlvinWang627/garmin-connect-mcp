# garmin-connect-mcp

MCP server for Garmin Connect. Access your fitness, health, and training data from Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client.

**61 tools** across 7 categories: activities, daily health, trends, sleep, body composition, performance/training, and profile/devices.

API endpoints and authentication flow based on [`python-garminconnect`](https://github.com/cyberjunky/python-garminconnect) by [cyberjunky](https://github.com/cyberjunky).

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- A Garmin Connect account (email and password)

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add garmin -e GARMIN_EMAIL=you@email.com -e GARMIN_PASSWORD=yourpass -- npx -y @nicolasvegam/garmin-connect-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nicolasvegam/garmin-connect-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_EMAIL": "you@email.com",
        "GARMIN_PASSWORD": "yourpass"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nicolasvegam/garmin-connect-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "GARMIN_EMAIL": "you@email.com",
        "GARMIN_PASSWORD": "yourpass"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@nicolasvegam/garmin-connect-mcp"],

## Authentication

Uses Garmin Connect credentials (email/password) via environment variables. OAuth tokens are cached in `~/.garmin-mcp/` to avoid re-authentication on each request.

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

If your Garmin account has MFA enabled (required for devices with ECG capabilities), you need to run the interactive setup once before using the MCP server:

```bash
GARMIN_EMAIL='you@email.com' GARMIN_PASSWORD='yourpass' npx -y @nicolasvegam/garmin-connect-mcp setup
```

This will:
1. Log in to Garmin Connect
2. Prompt you for the MFA code sent to your email or authenticator app
3. Save OAuth tokens to `~/.garmin-mcp/`

After setup, the MCP server will use the saved tokens automatically — no MFA prompt needed until the tokens expire. When they do, simply run the setup command again.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nicolasvegam/garmin-connect-mcp.git
cd garmin-connect-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

To test locally:

```bash
GARMIN_EMAIL=you@email.com GARMIN_PASSWORD=yourpass npm start
```

## Deployment to Cloudflare Workers

You can deploy this MCP server directly to Cloudflare Workers to serve MCP clients over HTTP / SSE (Server-Sent Events).

### 1. Configure Cloudflare Secrets

Login to Cloudflare and set your Garmin credentials as worker secrets:

```bash
npx wrangler login

# Set required secrets
npx wrangler secret put GARMIN_EMAIL
npx wrangler secret put GARMIN_PASSWORD

# (Optional) Set secret bearer token to restrict access
npx wrangler secret put AUTH_TOKEN
```

### 2. Set up Cloudflare KV for Token Persistence

KV is required for MFA-enabled Garmin accounts so the Worker can persist the
OAuth tokens after the one-time MFA enrollment:

```bash
npm run kv:create
```

Add the generated namespace ID to `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"kv_namespaces": [
  {
    "binding": "GARMIN_TOKENS",
    "id": "<YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID>"
  }
]
```

Also set a separate secret used only for the MFA enrollment endpoints:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put MFA_ADMIN_TOKEN
```

### 3. Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Once deployed, your worker URL (`https://garmin-connect-mcp.<subdomain>.workers.dev`) can be used as an HTTP/SSE MCP endpoint in compatible MCP clients.

### 4. Initialize MFA for a Worker

Gemini Spark can send the Garmin email and password, but it cannot answer an
interactive MFA prompt from inside a Worker request. Start the enrollment
from a trusted terminal instead. The Worker will use the `GARMIN_EMAIL` and
`GARMIN_PASSWORD` secrets configured above:

PowerShell:

```powershell
$workerUrl = "https://garmin-connect-mcp.<subdomain>.workers.dev"
$headers = @{ "x-mfa-admin-token" = "your-MFA_ADMIN_TOKEN"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" }

$start = Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "$workerUrl/auth/mfa/start" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers $headers `
  -Body '{}'

$start
```

Check the Garmin email, then submit the latest code:

```powershell
$verifyBody = @{ challengeId = $start.challengeId; code = "123456" } | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "$workerUrl/auth/mfa/verify" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers $headers `
  -Body $verifyBody
```

After `status: authenticated` is returned, connect the Worker URL in Gemini
Spark and enter the Garmin email and password in its credential fields. The
Worker will load the saved token from KV. Do not send the MFA code through the
Gemini conversation.
